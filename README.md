# A Sample Python Project

This repository serves as a template for developing python packages. Thereby this repo should mainly serve two purposes:

1. It should serve as an example for people who are new to python
2. There is no need to configure things like testing, documentation, and `setup.py` over and over again. This repo should serve as an initial python project seed which can be used to start off new python packages ðŸš€.â€‚

## How to Use

1. clone it to your local filesystem: `git clone git@github.com:tobirohrer/python-project-template.git` (depending on your needs, you can also [fork](https://github.com/tobirohrer/python-project-template/fork) the repo or [create your own repo based on this one](https://github.com/tobirohrer/python-project-template/generate))		
2. cd into the cloned repository: `cd python-project-template`
3. optional:

	4. create new python environment: `conda create -n <env_name> python=3.9`
	5. activate new python environment: `conda activate <env_name>`
6. install the package by: `pip install -e .[docs,tests]` (If you donÂ´t want to run tests or build the sphinx documentation locally, you can omit the `[docs,tests]` parameter)
7. run `python use_package.py` to use the sample package :)
