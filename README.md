# A sample python project

This repository serves as a template for developing python packages. Thereby this repo should mainly serve two purposes:

1. It should serve as an example for people who are new to python
2. There is no need to configure things like testing, documentation, and `setup.py` over and over again. This repo should serve as an initial python project seed which can be used to start off new python packages ðŸš€.â€‚
